# ü©∫ Diabetes Risk Predictor
This project uses machine learning to **predict an individual‚Äôs risk of diabetes** based on lifestyle and health factors from the **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 dataset**.  
It provides an interactive interface for users to input their health information and receive a real-time risk prediction.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Decision Tree Classifier** built with Scikit-learn  
- **Entropy-based splitting** with optimized `max_depth = 8` for balanced generalization  
- **5-fold stratified cross-validation** for model evaluation  
- **F1-score** used to measure prediction accuracy  
- **Matplotlib visualizations** to display feature importance  
- **Interactive user input interface** for real-time prediction

| `PhysActivity` | Regular physical activity | 1 = Yes, 0 = No |
| `Fruits` | Eats fruits regularly | 1 = Yes, 0 = No |
| `Veggies` | Eats vegetables regularly | 1 = Yes, 0 = No |
| `HvyAlcoholConsump` | Heavy alcohol consumption | 1 = Yes, 0 = No |
| `AnyHealthcare` | Has healthcare coverage | 1 = Yes, 0 = No |
| `GenHlth` | General health rating | 1‚Äì5 (1 = Excellent, 5 = Poor) |
| `PhysHlth` | Number of physically unhealthy days | numeric |
| `Sex` | Biological sex | 0 = Female, 1 = Male |
